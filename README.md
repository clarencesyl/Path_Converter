# Path_Converter
A Python program made with Tkinter.

Converts paths copied from Windows File Explorer to Python friendly paths.

e.g. C:\Users\User\Desktop -> C:/Users/User/Desktop

Use keyboard shortcuts "ctrl + c" and "ctrl + v" to copy and paste. Mouse right-click events are disabled.

Converted paths can also be used to navigate in command line across all operating systems.
